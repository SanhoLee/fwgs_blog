## DC(Direct Current)/AC(Alternating Current)
Probably we have heard about the terms, DC and AC, at science class when we were in middle school or high school. And I know roughle how it is different one and another. But when it comes to embbeded engineering, It's difficult to explain the concept and its difference.

So Let's look into how they are different when they are utilized in embedded system.

### DC(Direct Current)

### AC(Alternating Current)

What kind of points are important when I handle embedded system?
- 
- 
which type of electricity is prefered and popular in embbeded system ?
